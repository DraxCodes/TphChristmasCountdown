### TPH Christmas Countdown
This is a console based RPC (Rich presence) application. It will simply display some button that link to The Programmers Hangout discord server and their website.

The main purpose of this is to simply show a countdown until Christmas. It will work all year round so if you want to continue running it the year after, you can do so.

Currently I am fully supporting both Windows & Linux and semi supporting OSX. I have no way of testing OSX builds so until someone reports if it works or not, your mileage may vary. 

In the future I will support more runtimes such as ARM. However currently it's not available.

| Operating System  | Build Status |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Windows  | <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/draxcodes/TphChristmasCountdown/.NET?label=Windows&logo=windows&style=for-the-badge" />  |
| OSX  | <img alt="GitHub Workflow Status" src="https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/draxcodes/TphChristmasCountdown/.NET?label=OSX&logo=apple&style=for-the-badge">  |
